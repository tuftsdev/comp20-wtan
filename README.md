1. The purpose of this repository is to track the learning that we have accomplised through the semester 
as well as a method to share what we have done.

2. My favourite assignment was assignment 3 as it shed light on how web applications and web servers might function
along with teaching me how to go about doing so by myself. It also showed the various security vulnerabilities which
I would have to consider if an application was intended for the general public.

3. I think I have grown alot from day 1 of the course till now. It made me alot more accepting of using other codes
and taught me about asynchronicity, responsive design, higher order functions, and other concepts which I could put to
use in future designs. It also taught me about basic web structure which would act as a springbroad towards other languages,
algorithms and make the path of learning and understanding slightly easier in the future.

4. The most important thing I have learnt in the course are client-server interfaces in web applications.
An example of this would be the interaction between assignment 2 to the /submit route on assignment 3. 
Another example would be browser interfacing with web applications such as the lesson on 'What happens when you type
google.com in your browser and hit enter'

5. I would like to delve deeper into data science and encryption as I have realized if there is true malicious intent, 
there are many ways available to manipulate data, dump data, send invalid data, and learning encryption and managing
huge datasets would be useful in the future development of the concepts available to me.
