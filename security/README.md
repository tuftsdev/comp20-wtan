Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented include testing for mongoDB search Params, 
testing for XSS vulnerabilities, testing for invalid data input, thinking about the process
and usage the app is intended for and thus finding vulnerabilities that may be exploited.

I have not collaborated or discussed with anyone for this assignment, besides reading online for
possible vulnerabilities.

I have spent approximately 3-4hrs on this assignment.
