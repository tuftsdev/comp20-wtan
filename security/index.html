<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>
<p>
	The product was intended to simulate the tracking of passengers and vehicles around the world interacting with a software.<br>
	I was hired to test the product for security vulnerabilities and bad programming practiced<br>
</p>
<h1>
	Methodology
</h1>
<p>
	First, I tested the site for XSS vulnerabilities. On posting to &sol;submit using CURL, I swapped the usernames from a valid<br>
	one to a script tag a: for example &lt;script&gt; alert("hi") &lt;&sol;script&gt;. This test was also done for the fields lat<br>
	and lng. After this initial test, I then went through the source code to trace the path where input data takes to locate<br>
	more security vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<h1>
	Abstract of Findings
</h1>
<p>
	Security issues found include that while data is validated to prevent hostile scripts, data entry is not and the validation of<br>
	the fields are lax apart from script checking. There also exist fundamental privacy issues with the functionality of the application<br>
	including the ability to track where the app is sending data to and from there finding out passengers and even vehicle listing.<br>
</p>

<h1>
	Issues Found
</h1>

<h2>Issue: Unlimited field entries</h2>
<p>
	Page found: limitless-springs-63304.herokuapp.com<br><br>

	Description of issue: The field for username has no form of checking if the request is made from a valid site, allowing for <br>
	constant posting which makes it hard for users of the site to figure out passenger traffic.<br><br>

	Severity of issue: Medium as it does not compromise the actual usage of the application until the database has been overloaded<br>
	which would then render it unable to serve its purpose from the passenger database. Empty strings are allowed as well<br><br>

	Proof of vulnerability:<br>
	<img src="security_1.png" alt="security vulnerability"><br>

	Resolution: Use local storage/cookies and return functions to track if the same platform is being used to send data repeatedly<br>
	Limit username length by the following code: if (username.length > 8) response.send(403)<br>
</p>

<h2>Issue: Invalid variables allowed</h2>
<p>
	Page found: limitless-springs-63304.herokuapp.com/submit<br><br>

	Description of issue: The field for lat and lng only check for numerical data and do not send feedback for faulty submissions<br><br>

	Severity of issue: Low as it does not compromise the actual usage of the application. Google Maps renders NaN at 0.<br>
	However, if any code was to rely on proper latitudes and longitudes, they would not work in the future<br>
	This would also help to check for faulty script on the client side when they do not send valid latitude and longitudes<br>
	This is especially the case if the way the distance is calculated is not from the Google Maps API as it could easily lead to console errors<br><br>

	Proof of vulnerability:<br>
	<img src="security_2.png" alt="security vulnerability 2"><br>

	Resolution: Check if input lat falls between -90 and 90 while longitude falls between -180 to 180 and respond with an error<br>
</p>

<h2> Issue: Missing function level access control</h2>
<p>
	Page found: limitless-springs-63304.herokuapp.com/vehicles.json<br><br>

	Description of issue: The field for username has no form of checking if the request is made from a valid site, allowing for <br>
	constant probing of the website for vehicles. When done along with assignment 2, list of vehicles can easily be tallied<br><br>

	Severity of issue: Medium as privacy may be compromised from the users to the vehicles travelling and their last known location<br>
	That being the case, every user would thus be able to keep track of all of the vehicles and the people driving them.(once known)<br>
	It is also possible to brute force the username through schrips should the usernames be insufficiently long enough, which<br>
	one can determine simply through the client-side interface<br><br>

	Proof of vulnerability:<br>
	<img src="security_3.png" alt="security vulnerability 3"><br>

	Resolution: Assign passwords and require form of authentication when accessing vehicles.json<br>
</p>

<h1>
	Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
	For a Uber-like service to be done, the usernames of the cars should not be transmitted to the client for privacy purposes<br>
	Other requirements include authentication which preferably should be attached to a hash reliant on time to prevent interception<br>
	by proxies and easy decryption. Although inputs were checked, the source of the input should be checked to prevent too much <br>
	information from the same source, and the all fields should be checked if valid, preferably through signups, thus cataloguing<br>
	passengers in an array. To this end, the base website should also be encrypted and require authentication to prevent stalking <br>
	of passengersas a privacy measure<br>
