Done by Winston Tan, wtan02
On 5th March 2017.

Parts of the assignment that have been correctly implemented:
navigation.geolocation was used properly. A custom icon was used for 
my position along with my username. Vehicles are marked with the black
car provided on the website. Information windows are also correctly 
implemented on the map. Distance is done in miles along with their usernames.
Minor styling has been done. Files are in the locations they should be in.
XMLHttpRequest was used succesfully to post to the API as requested.

I have received help from the TA Michael for some issues regarind infoWindows.

An approximate of 10-12 hours was spent on this assignment 
(mainly going in circles and meeting bugs).
